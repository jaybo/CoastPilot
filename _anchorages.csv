"<p class=\"cp_paragraph\"><span class=\"cp_paraindex\">(2)</span><div class=\"cp_text\"> The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is a series of ten nautical books (volumes) that encompasses a wide variety of information important to navigators of U.S. coastal/intracoastal waters and the waters of the Great Lakes. The Coast Pilot is intended to be used as a supplement to NOAA nautical charts. Much of the content cannot be shown graphically on the charts and is not readily available elsewhere. Topics which are covered include environmental factors of weather, climate, ice conditions, tides, water levels, currents, prominent coastal features and landmarks. Specific information on vertical clearances, wharf descriptions, small-craft facilities, hazards, dredged channels and depths are also provided. Navigation services and regulations are also identified including pilotage, towing, anchorages, routes and traffic separation schemes, environmental protection, and other Federal laws.</div></p>","10","1"
